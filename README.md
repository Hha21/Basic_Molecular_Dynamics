## High-Performance Computing Coursework: Lennard-Jones Particle Simulation
This repository contains a particle simulation code designed to compute particle dynamics using the Lennard-Jones potential. It includes multiple implementations, leveraging different parallel computing approaches:
   - Serial Implementation (Baseline)
   - Shared-Memory Parallelism (OpenMP)
   - GPU Parallelism (CUDA)
